# NC data archive

A repository of scraped data about North Carolina, created at NICAR21, using GitHub Actions and git scraping.

Inspired by [Simon Willison's tutorials](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/) and coronavirus scrapers from [The Los Angeles Times](https://github.com/datadesk/california-coronavirus-scrapers).
